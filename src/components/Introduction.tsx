    <p>
      Hi, I'm Shafi! I am a passionate software engineer with a comprehensive background in programming. During my Bachelor's degree, I have explored a variety of full stack development projects, working with several tech stacks along the way. In my Master's degree, I took a deeper dive into the realm of cybersecurity, focusing on low-level programming and security aspects. During my Master's degree, I also worked full-time as a Graduate Software Developer, more of which you can learn about below.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently very interested about the possibilities that the integration of AI can have in web applications, particularly in the aspect of creating uniquely tailored user experiences.
